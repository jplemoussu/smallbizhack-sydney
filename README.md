## Implementing the QuickBooks API

#### Wait one sec... Tell me what it does first!
Every small business needs to track their income, expense and profits, pay employees or lodge tax. They use an accounting application like QuickBooks to automate these painful tasks. QuickBooks is designed as an open ecosystem for small businesses, so YOU can build an app which hooks onto QuickBooks, to solve the myriad of other painpoints associated with running a business. 

Once your app is granted access to their QuickBooks account by a business owner, you can consume a rich set of financial data via the QuickBooks acccounting APIs. You can use this data and the available  APIs to to help them run their business more efficiently. 

Common tasks performed by the QuickBooks API include:
* Manage customers and vendors databases 
* Manage sales-side transactions (invoices, sales receipt) and purchase-side (bills, expenses) transactions.
* Retrieve reports: profit and loss, outstanding invoices...
* Manage product inventory

Check the [API reference](https://developer.intuit.com/docs/api/accounting) for the complete list of APIs. Do also check our app marketplace [apps.com](www.apps.com) for example of use cases and apps which use our APIs.


## Setting up OAuth access

This section takes you through the steps for acquiring the OAuth 2.0 token to make your first API calls. There are some available libraries to generate OAuth tokens, but for simplicty sake we'll show you a trick to manually generate the token and get to your first succesful API call in minutes!
